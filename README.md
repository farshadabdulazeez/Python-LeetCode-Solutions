# LeetCode Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Python. The solutions are organized by problem number, and each solution includes a clear and concise explanation.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `python_solutions_with_explanation`: The main folder containing all the LeetCode problem solutions.
- `Question_<Number>`: Each subfolder corresponds to a specific problem on LeetCode, identified by its number. Each solution folder contains both the code and an explanation. The explanations provide insights into the problem-solving approach and details about the implemented solution

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions for different problems. Each solution folder contains both the code (`solution.py`) and an explanation (`explanation.md`). The explanations provide insights into the problem-solving approach and details about the implemented solution.

## Contributions

If you have a different or more optimized solution, or if you'd like to contribute improvements to the explanations, feel free to create a pull request. Contributions are highly appreciated!

## Notes

- These solutions are intended for educational purposes and to showcase different approaches to solving problems.
- Make sure to understand the problem requirements before checking the solutions to get the most out of the learning experience.

Happy coding!
